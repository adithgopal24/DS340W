We aim to improve upon existing measurements of batter swing decision quality in Major League Baseball. For every pitch a batter sees, he has the decision to swing at or take that pitch. Taking a pitch can result in a ball, a strike, or a hit by pitch. Swinging at a pitch can result in an out, foul, single, double, triple, or home run. By using two separate machine learning models, one for swings and one for takes, we can estimate the probability of each event occuring given the initial swing decision. Knowing the value of each outcome using run values (home runs are good, outs are bad, etc.), we can combine this information with the probabilities calculated to determine the optimal swing decision for every pitch thrown in the league. These results can be aggregated to estimate a swing decision grade for all MLB batters.
